# Student_Result_Management_System
A Web based project on student result management system.
It is a php based project.
It can be considered as a project to submit in your college end sem projects and you can also do it as your personal interest.
It is a simple project to show the result of the student.
There are 2 sections here.
   One is the admin.
   Second is the user.
The user has the rights to manipulate the data of the student i.e adding, deleting,updating the data.
Set up:--
     First You have to download the project.

     Then create a new database on the name of the student_result_management_system.
     Import the sql file in the folder then your database file will vbe created.
